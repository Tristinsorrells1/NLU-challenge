# NLU Code Challenge!

## Installation Instructions:

### Run the application locally using Webapck
- Clone this repository to your local machine and CD into the directory. 
- Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to get a local host URL. 
- Copy the local host URL given and paste it into your browser to view the website.

### Run the local server
- Run `node server.js`.
- To stop the local server from running in your terminal use `command + c`.
    
## App Demo
Here is a short video demonstration: [video](https://www.loom.com/share/3146eef085714035880f834406aaaf0e?sid=2c6a51a7-98b0-45d0-95e8-21bda62cf967)

## Future Considerations
- I would like to use Axe DevTools and Google Lighthouse for Accessibility Testing.
- I would like to deploy the server and the front end using Vercel.
- I would like to continue to style the components to give the website a more uniform look that is consistent with other NLU branding.
- I'd like to write E2E tests using Cypress.
